## 4. Least Profitable Product Subcategory and Country in Southeast Asia: Envelopes

### Overview

The least profitable product subcategory in Southeast Asia is **envelopes**, generating losses across multiple countries in the region.

### Key Profit Data from Southeast Asia

- **Indonesia** experiences the largest envelope loss at approximately **-$1,641**, followed by the **Philippines (-$1,714)** and **Thailand (-$338)**.  
- Smaller losses appear in **Myanmar (-$52)** and **Vietnam (-$1,870)**, highlighting regional consistency in unprofitability.

### Possible Causes of Envelope Losses

- **Low Sales Price & Margin:** Envelopes have low unit prices, and discounts reduce profitability.

- **Excessive Discounting:** Heavy discounting compresses margins and sometimes leads to losses.  
- **Market Saturation & Competition:** Mature markets drive price competition and margin erosion.  
- **Supply Chain Inefficiencies:** Cross-border imports and import duties add costs not offset by revenues.

### Recommendations

- Review pricing and discount strategies to protect margins.  
- Improve supply chains, explore local sourcing, and optimize distribution.  
- Bundle envelopes with higher-margin products to boost profitability.  
- Consider halting or limiting envelope sales in persistently loss-making countries.
